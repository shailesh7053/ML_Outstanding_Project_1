# ML_Outstanding_Project_1
Building Logistic Regression , SVM OR Naïve Bayes model For Who's Survived in Titanic Disaster



• Project Name:
Machine Learning Outstanding Project

• Problem Statement:-
Project 1 :

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous wrecks in history. On April 15, 1912,
during her maiden voyage, the RMS Titanic, widely considered “unsinkable”, sank after
hitting an iceberg. Unfortunately, there were not enough lifeboats for everyone on board,
resulting in the deaths of 1,502 out of 2,224 passengers and crew. While there was an
element of luck in survival, it appears that certain groups of people were more likely to
survive than others.
You have to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck based on data such as
their age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. For example, it is highly probable that someone
rich from the first-class survived as compared to someone from the third class. You can use
the Titanic dataset on Kaggle for this project. And just to make things more interesting, this
dataset contains real data based on the people who died and survived the actual Titanic
disaster.Use a classification technique ( Logistic regression, SVM OR Naïve Bayes) to predict
whether a passenger will survive based on the characteristics of the data.
